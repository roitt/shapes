 * Created by rbhoompally on 12/1/15.
 *
 * This class is responsible for handling shape generation.
 * The task is to take the the difficulty level as input and generate a map contains shapes.
 * The generated map should have all shapes of similar kind, and can overlap.
 *
 * Let us assume we have a difficulty level of 0 to 10, 0 being the easiest and 10 being the hardest.
